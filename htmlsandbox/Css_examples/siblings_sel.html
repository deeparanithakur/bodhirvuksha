        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
        It has survived not only five centuries, 
       <em

       >but also the leap into electronic typesetting,remaining essentially unchanged.</strong

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source.
