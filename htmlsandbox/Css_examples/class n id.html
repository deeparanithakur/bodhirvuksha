    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p class ="fancy">
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged.

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source.

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, 
        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
